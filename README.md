The ViewModel class is used to store and manage user interface data in a lifecycle-aware manner. It allows data to survive screen rotations and other configuration changes. It also enhances the implementation of the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern, which is Googleâ€™s recommended Android app architecture for Android applications.

The ViewModel remains in memory until the Lifecycle it's scoped to goes away permanently,
The ViewModel exists from when you first request a ViewModel until the activity is finished and destroyed.
